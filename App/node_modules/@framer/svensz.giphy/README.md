# Overview

Embed GIFs and stickers from [GIPHY](https://www.giphy.com) in your designs. 

Just drag and drop the Giphy component onto your artboard and specify a tag. The component will display a random GIF powered by GIPHY.

# How to use

Three options can be specified in the component: 

**GIF Type**: Here it is possible to select the GIF type. Currently classic GIFs or stickers (GIFs with transparent background) are possible.

**GIF Search**: Here you can enter a search term and confirm it by pressing Enter. You can also scroll through the randomly found GIFs by pressing Enter while having this input field in focus.

**Lock GIF**: With this toggle you can lock a found GIF. If the lock is active, the GIF will not be changed when you move the GIF around or enter another search term. Remember though: GIFs won't be downloaded. If you open the document another time, another GIF will be placed. This world is full of randomness!
