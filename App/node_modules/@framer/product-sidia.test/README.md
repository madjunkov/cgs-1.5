### Description
Just a regular frame with some nice “ripple” effect when tapped/clicked.  Configurable `Duration`, `Size`, `Radius`, and `Color`. When set to `Auto`, ripple `Size` will always cover the entire Frame.

### How to use
* It works just like a regular Frame
* Install, drag to your canvas
* Resize and tweak it at will
* Click over it in the Preview window
* Enjoy the ripples!

### Disclaimers
* The component was made as an exercise over Framer X
* This version doesn’t work when Preview is “Scaling to fit"
* It might not work when nested in other Frames
* Beware, this is my first React code ever 💩
